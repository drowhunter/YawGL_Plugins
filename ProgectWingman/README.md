<b>Plugin for Project Wingman (Anniversary Edition)</b>

This plugin can be updated directly from the YawVR repository, 
i.e. when a new version of the game is released the game memory addresses
can be directly pushed to the plugin, so that it is a fully automated
and transparent process for the user.

But if needed, the memory addresses can also be updated manually:
for this you just need to put an updated XML file, on the model here
in the Resources folder, in the same folder as the dll, i.e. in
GameLink's Gameplugins folder.
